## course description

theory:

- intro fundamental problems of ml
  - each ch is a different algorithm
  - we'll then use that algo to solve some problem
- analyze limits & perf of diff algos

application:

- derive algos from fundamentals
- apply algos to real-world datasets
- develop a project using ml algos

### topics overview

- ml fundamentals
- decision tree
- support vector machine
- naive-bayes
- logistic regression
- linear regression
- nearest neighbor
- clustering
- principal component analysis
- artificial neural networks
- convolutional neural network
- recurrent neural network

### prereqs

- multivariate calculus
- probs & stats
- ds & a
- linear algebra
- python programming

### grading

weights:

| task        | weight |
| ----------- | ------ |
| assignments | 20%    |
| prj         | 25%    |
| midterm     | 25%    |
| final       | 30%    |

scheme:

| value  | grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| >= 90% | A     |
| >= 80% | B     |
| >= 70% | C     |
| >= 60% | D     |
| <= 60% | E     |

## assignment details

- 3 or 4 individual assignments
- equally weighted
- submitted on canvas as jupyter notebooks
- submissions _must be properly titled_ (e.g. chang-dewitt_Assignment_1.ipynb)

## exam details

- 1 midterm, 1 final
- midterm on 2025/10/8
- final exam **is cumulative**
- exams are _closed book_, but handwritten cheat sheet allowed (single A4
  paper, double-sided)
- will need scientific calculator
- two sections:
  1. short form (1-2 word responses)
  2. long-form (mathematical questions, showing your work)

## project details

- requires group, ideally 3, not more than 4
- each team will maintain a single powerpoint file which captures entire project
  - ~5-page project proposal (9/21)
  - mid-semester update, + ~10 pages (10/26)
  - final update, + ~10 pages (11/23)
  - demo & submit a final report
- each student in team graded equally

examples from previous semsters found on canvas

prj should be on some topic broad enough to allow for a good project, recommended to choose a topic on use of neural networks.

## late policy

- total of 7 late days useable for entire semester
- for assignments only really, but could possibly be used on project w/
  communication w/ prof
